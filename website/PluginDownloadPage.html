                <li>While navigating the 'For You' page, begin by browsing the news by selecting articles that you want to read. Note that the webpage will automatically refresh after you select a piece of news; this is the expected behavior. For the purpose of this study, there is no requirement to read the content of the news article.

            <ul>
                <li>Repeat the news selection several times. The system will provide additional prompts once your browsing meets our standards. Throughout the process, please remain focused and engaged, as you will be asked to complete a follow-up survey containing questions related to the content. Our system will also employ technological tools to confirm your attentiveness. Inattention may result in a reduced payment.</li>
            </ul>  
            <ul>
                <li>Once you have finished browsing the news and met our completion standards, our system will give you a link to the final survey. After completing this survey, you will receive a code to claim your final payment on Prolific.</li>
